# DSA-custom-header-file
DSA custom header files contain declarations of functions, variables, and data structures for a particular set of DSA functions and structures.
They modularize code, improve organisation, and enable code reuse.
Custom header files can include declarations for functions like sorting or searching algorithms, or data structures like linked lists, stacks, or queues.
Custom header files help avoid repetitive coding in different programs.
This approach saves time and effort and makes the code more modular and readable.
